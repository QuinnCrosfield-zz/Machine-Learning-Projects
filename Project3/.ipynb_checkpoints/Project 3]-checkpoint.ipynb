    "Friday, January 24th: Complete a google form telling me who you’ll work with, and what you think your\n",
    "topic will be. You are free to change your topic over the weekend, however.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monday, January 27th: Complete your project plan by the beginning of class, to be ready to discuss it.\n",

    "Friday, January 31st: Submit project through moodle.\n",
    "\n",
    " You may choose to work on any machine learning\n",
    "project of your choice. This could be similar to the types of regression or classification that we’ve done\n",
    "so far, or could be on machine learning related to text (things like sentiment analysis, or text generation),\n",
    "or could be on machine learning related to images (things like image recognition, or image generation), or\n",
    "another area of machine learning altogether.\n",
    "The only requirements for the project are that it should require you to go through the process of preparing\n",
    "data (in some form), some kind of exploratory data analysis, training and testing machine learning algorithms (including some parameter tuning), and evaluating the performance of your models.\n",
    "Depending on the difficulty of your project, it might not be realistic for you to complete the entire process in\n",
    "one week. For this reason, it’s very important that you give a detailed outline of the plan for your project.\n",
    "Hopefully, if you’ve chosen a project that you are unable to complete during the term, you’ll continue to\n",
    "work on it after the course is over.\n",
    "Once you’ve chosen your project, complete the following tasks.\n",
    "Write a Plan. Before you start working on your project, make a detailed plan for the workflow of your\n",
    "project. Write up this plan, and include it at the beginning of your Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "Your plan should include the following:\n",
    "• What will be your goal in working on this project?\n",
    "• What will be your source for data for the project? If this requires you to gather data, how will you go\n",
    "about this?\n",
    "• What data cleaning, conversion, or preparation will you need to do to prepare your data set?\n",
    "• What kinds of exploratory data analysis will you do?\n",
    "• Which machine learning algorithms will you use to train models? Why are you choosing these algorithms?\n",
    "• How will you attempt to optimize your models?\n",
    "• How will you analyze the accuracy of your models?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very important that your plan is complete and very detailed, in order to show a thorough understanding\n",
    "of the process of training a model using machine learning, in case you don’t have time to fully complete your\n",
    "project. You should have a draft of your plan completed by the beginning of class on Monday,\n",
    "January 27th, so that we can discuss it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gathering Data. Following the outline given in your plan, gather the data that you require for your\n",
    "project. Depending on your project, this might be as simple as downloading a data set, or it might involve\n",
    "combining multiple data sources, or gathering data yourself. If your project requires you to gather your own\n",
    "data, please discuss this with me before beginning, so that we can make sure you have a realistic plan to\n",
    "gather enough data.\n",
    "Preparing Your Data Set. Following the outline given in your plan, prepare your data set for training.\n",
    "This might include handling missing or categorical values, basic conversions, or more extensive conversions.\n",
    "Any choices that you make should be explained.\n",
    "Exploratory Data Analysis. Following the outline given in your plan, perform some exploratory data\n",
    "analysis. Discuss the results, and what this tells you about your data, as well as your expectations for your\n",
    "results. This should include some data visualization.\n",
    "Train Models Using Machine Learning Algorithms. Although you do not need to use every algorithm\n",
    "that we’ve covered, you should use those that make sense for your data set. You should explain your choices,\n",
    "and perform parameter tuning in order to optimize their performance.\n",
    "Discussion of Results. Compare the performance of your models, and discuss the results. Do you consider your results successful? Explain why or why not, and discuss how further improvements might be made.\n",
    "Evaluation of Your Plan. Discuss how closely you were able to follow your initial plan. What unexpected\n",
    "issues did you encounter? What adjustments did you need to make? How would this affect planning a future\n",
    "machine learning project?\n",
    "For this project, you will submit a Jupyter Notebook through moodle by Friday, January 31st, and you will\n",
    "give an in-class presentation on Thursday, January 30th or Friday, January 31st.\n",
    "Grading\n",
    "There are a maximum of 25 points possible for this project. I will post a rubric for the project early next\n",
    "week. In order to incentivize students to choose challenging projects, when grading, I will assign your\n",
    "project a difficulty multiplier for each category. This way, if your project involves very difficult data preparation, and you are only able to barely start exploratory data analysis, it still may be possible to get full credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Project Presentations and Responses\n",
    "There are a lot of interesting project presentations happening at the end of January term: the math modeling class, physics modeling class, and board game development class will also be presenting their final\n",
    "projects. We will put together a combined schedule for presentations, and encourage our students to attend\n",
    "presentations from other classes.\n",
    "For your presentation, this means that you should anticipate that your audience will include people from\n",
    "outside of this class, who probably don’t know anything about machine learning! I encourage you to consider this when preparing your presentation, and aim to explain your project at a level that is accessible to\n",
    "a general audience.\n",
    "For your project responses, you are required to attend and respond to at least four presentations from other\n",
    "classes. You can attend and respond to additional presentations for some extra credit; I’ll give more details\n",
    "about this closer to the presentations.\n",
    "Additional Extra Credit\n",
    "At the beginning of the semester, I mentioned how it would fun to take a recipe generated with machine\n",
    "learning, try making it (without setting anything on fire), and see how it goes. If you want to try this, and\n",
    "talk about it for a couple of minutes at the beginning of class on Wednesday, January 29th, you can earn 2\n",
    "points of extra credit for the course. Hopefully you will also provide pictures.\n",
    "If you have other ideas for ways that you can experiment with using goofy results from machine learning,\n",
    "that could also work. Just let me know your idea, and we’ll talk about whether it warrants some extra\n",
    "credit."
